## v1 — MVP (Core BTC Invoicing)

> Goal: A working product a freelancer can use today. Create an invoice, share it, get paid in BTC.

---

### ✅ v1.0 — Project Foundation

**Branch:** `v1.0/foundation`

- [x] Next.js App Router project with TypeScript
- [x] Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui dark theme configured (bg `#0A0A0A`, surface `#181818`, accent `#DE3C4B`)
- [x] Supabase project linked; `invoices` table + enums + RLS policies
- [x] Magic link auth via Supabase Auth
- [x] Auth proxy (proxy.ts, Next.js 16) protecting `/dashboard` and related routes
- [x] Basic layout: navbar, authenticated shell

**Done when:** A user can sign in via magic link and land on an empty dashboard.

---

### ✅ v1.1 — Invoice CRUD + Dashboard

**Branch:** `v1.1/invoice-crud`

- [x] Invoice creation form: client name, client email, line items, optional tax, due date, BTC address
- [x] BTC address uniqueness validation (no reuse across non-draft invoices)
- [x] Save as draft
- [x] Publish invoice: generates 8-char alphanumeric access code + shareable link
- [x] Dashboard: list all invoices with status badge (draft, pending, payment_detected, paid, overdue)
- [x] Delete draft invoice
- [x] Mark invoice as overdue (manual)

**Done when:** A freelancer can create, publish, and manage invoices from their dashboard.

---

### ✅ v1.1.1 — Invoice Form Improvements

**Branch:** `fix/invoice-form-improvements`

**Schema changes**
- [x] Add `invoice_number` (text, nullable) to invoices table
- [x] Replace `tax_fiat` with `tax_percent` (numeric, default 0) — store as %, compute fiat at save time
- [x] Add sender fields: `your_name`, `your_email`, `your_company`, `your_address`, `your_tax_id` (all text, nullable)
- [x] Add client fields: `client_company`, `client_address`, `client_tax_id` (all text, nullable)
- [x] Add `accepts_bitcoin` (boolean, default false)
- [x] Change `access_code` to be nullable and user-set (no auto-generation)
- [x] Add `btc_address` nullable when `accepts_bitcoin` is false

**Form UX**
- [x] Split form header: "YOU" (left) / "CLIENT" (right) with full sender + client fields
- [x] Invoice number field (freeform text, max 50 chars)
- [x] Tax field: percent input (%), compute fiat on save
- [x] Due date: shadcn date picker + "No due date" toggle
- [x] Quantity and unit price: freeform (empty = 0 on submit), max qty 100,000 / max unit price 1,000,000,000, 2 decimal places, no spinner arrows
- [x] "Accept Bitcoin" toggle — shows BTC address field only when enabled
- [x] Access code: user-set text field OR "No access code" toggle (no auto-generation)
- [x] Remove red asterisks from all fields
- [x] Email validation (valid format if entered, not required)

**Invoice detail page**
- [x] Mark as paid button (manual, for non-BTC or already-confirmed payments)
- [x] Edit draft button → pre-populated edit form (same as new invoice form)
- [x] Fix share link: show full URL (`http://...`), add copy button with copied feedback
- [x] Fix route: `/invoice/[id]` public route stub (placeholder until v1.2)

**Done when:** All form feedback addressed, draft editing works, share link copies correctly.

---

### ✅ v1.1.2 — Invoice Form Polish

**Branch:** `fix/invoice-form-improvements` (continued)

- [x] Form too left-aligned — remove `max-w-2xl` constraint, let dashboard width govern
- [x] Add visual gap/separator between YOU and CLIENT columns
- [x] Line items: rewrite with flex rows (grid arbitrary values unreliable), keep no-spinners + allow empty
- [x] Tax % input: replace absolute-positioned `%` with inline flex suffix; remove spinners
- [x] Date picker: widens automatically once form width is fixed
- [x] Access code: remove checkbox, single optional input labelled "Access code (Optional)"
- [x] Remove client name as a required field — all client fields optional

**Done when:** Form looks balanced, line items are horizontal, tax field is clean, access code is simplified.

---

### ✅ v1.1.3 — Invoice Form Layout & Validation Fixes

**Branch:** `fix/invoice-form-improvements` (continued)

**Layout**
- [x] Fix YOU/CLIENT sections — columns side-by-side with centred divider and clear gap (inline styles to work around Tailwind v4 gap/padding generation bug)
- [x] Line items: column headers (Description, Qty, Unit price) in same div as their inputs — mirrors Field pattern, labels only on first row, subsequent rows align underneath
- [x] Line items: use inline `gap` style so column widths are consistent across all rows
- [x] Dynamic page title — reverted; title stays as static "New Invoice" / "Edit Invoice"
- [x] Remove Tax % suffix element — label now reads "Tax (%)" instead

**Validation & input behaviour**
- [x] Email validation: only validates format if an email is entered; blank is allowed for both sender and client
- [x] Allow "0" as a valid quantity or unit price (tracked as raw string; zero no longer collapses to empty display)
- [x] Invoice number: max 50 characters enforced via `maxLength` attribute and validation
- [x] Qty field: no placeholder after deletion — field is blank when empty, no greyed "1" re-appearing
- [x] Qty / Unit price inputs changed to `type="text" inputMode="decimal"` — eliminates spinners, scroll-wheel changes, and arrow-key increments entirely
- [x] Tax input likewise changed to `type="text" inputMode="decimal"`
- [x] Fix `client_email` / `your_email` NOT NULL constraint — send empty string instead of null when blank
- [x] New line items added via "+ Add line item" now prefill qty with "1" (matching the initial row)

**Done when:** YOU and CLIENT sit side by side with a centre divider; column headers align with their inputs; all input behaviour matches spec above.

---

### ✅ v1.1.4 — Invoice UX Polish

**Branch:** `fix/invoice-form-improvements` (continued)

**Routing**
- [x] `/invoices` route shows the invoice list (same as `/dashboard`); `/dashboard` redirects to `/invoices`

**Invoice form**
- [x] Remove `heading-invoice-title` element from the invoice form — title lives on the page, not inside the form component
- [x] Close vertical space between field rows within YOU and CLIENT sections
- [x] Scroll page to first failed validation field when a form submission fails validation
- [x] Stop `client_name` defaulting to "Unnamed" when left blank — allow empty
- [x] Cancel button at the bottom of the edit invoice form; if the form is dirty, show a confirmation modal before discarding changes

**Invoice detail page**
- [x] Fix centering — detail page content is left-aligned within the wide layout container; add `mx-auto`
- [x] Replace client name in the large header with the invoice number; remove the smaller inline invoice number beside it
- [x] Add "Mark as unpaid" action for paid invoices (reverts status to pending)

**Done when:** All items above are checked off.

---

### ✅ v1.1.5 — Form Validation, Nav & Date Picker

**Branch:** `fix/invoice-form-improvements` (continued)

**Routing & nav**
- [x] Navbar "Paybitty" logo text links to home (`/invoices`)

**Form validation hardening**
- [x] Qty field: enforce max 100,000 and max 2 decimal places (validate on submit, not on keystroke)
- [x] Unit price field: enforce max 1,000,000,000 and max 2 decimal places (validate on submit)

**Date picker**
- [x] Replace current narrow date picker with the correctly-sized shadcn date picker matching the component docs (proper popover width, calendar styling)

**ID coverage**
- [x] Create a reusable `add-ids` skill that audits the UI and adds appropriately named `id` attributes to all key elements
- [x] Run the skill across all pages and components so every interactive and structural element has a stable ID

**Done when:** Nav logo navigates home, validation rejects out-of-range qty/price, date picker matches shadcn docs, all key elements have IDs.

---

### ✅ v1.2 — Client Payment View + BTC QR Code

**Branch:** `v1.2/client-payment-view`

> Note: `/invoice/[id]` currently shows a "Client payment view coming soon" stub. This branch replaces it with the full implementation.

- [x] Public route `/invoice/[id]` with access code gate
- [x] BTC price fetching API: `GET /api/btc-price?currency=USD` (Coinbase primary, CoinGecko fallback, ~60s server-side cache)
- [x] BTC amount computed from live price at view time
- [x] BIP21 QR code generated (`bitcoin:<address>?amount=<btc>&label=<label>`)
- [x] Client view: invoice details, fiat total, BTC amount, QR code

**Also fixed on this branch**
- [x] BTC address conflict error: shows inline below field (not top of form), scrolls to field, friendly message naming the conflicting invoice
- [x] BTC conflict check covers all non-draft statuses (was only checking `pending`; DB index covers all)
- [x] Centralised `parseServerError()` utility — error message wording lives in one place
- [x] Conflict error falls back to short invoice ID (`…xxxxxxxx`) when conflicting invoice has no number

**Done when:** A client can open a link, enter an access code, see the invoice, and scan a QR code to pay.

---

### ✅ v1.3 — Payment Detection

**Branch:** `v1.3/payment-detection`

- [x] mempool.space WebSocket connection opened client-side on the payment view page
- [x] 0-conf event: update invoice status to `payment_detected`
- [x] 1-conf event: update invoice status to `paid`
- [x] Fallback: exponential backoff polling (30s start, doubles, caps ~10min)
- [x] WebSocket closed once invoice reaches `paid`
- [x] Real-time status UI update on client payment page
- [x] `btc_txid` saved when payment is detected or confirmed; displayed in both user and client views as a link to mempool.space
- [x] BTC address validation — checksum-verified (bech32, bech32m, base58check) on both client form and server action; invalid addresses blocked at publish time

> **Deferred to v1.4:** On-login sweep of all `pending` / `payment_detected` invoices — detected payments are caught when any relevant invoice page is viewed, which covers the common case. A background sweep at login will be added in v1.4 alongside email notifications (same session).

**Done when:** Payment detection works end-to-end with live and fallback paths; invalid BTC addresses are rejected at publish time.

---

### ✅ v1.3.1 — Invoice View & List Date Polish

**Branch:** `v1.3.1/invoice-date-polish`

- [x] Invoice detail page (user view): add "Date Sent" (created/published date) and "Date Due" — currently shows no date information
- [x] Client payment view: already shows "Due" date — add "Date Sent" alongside it for full context
- [x] `/invoices` list: replace creation date with due date; label it "Due \<date\>" to avoid ambiguity (invoices with no due date show a dash or nothing)

**Done when:** Both views clearly surface sent and due dates; the invoice list shows due date with unambiguous label.

---

### ✅ v1.3.2 — Invoice List Management

**Branch:** `v1.3.2/invoice-list-management`

- [x] Multi-select checkboxes on the `/invoices` list
- [x] Bulk action dropdown appears when one or more invoices are selected: Delete, Archive, Mark as Paid
- [x] Archive status: add `archived` to invoice status enum; archived invoices hidden from main list by default (consider a toggle to show them)
- [x] Bulk delete: confirm before executing; only draft invoices deletable in bulk (or confirm for non-draft)
- [x] Bulk mark as paid: applies to selected non-paid invoices

**Done when:** User can select multiple invoices and apply bulk actions from a single dropdown.

---

### ✅ v1.3.3 — Payment Sent Button & Reveal Gate

**Branch:** `v1.3.3/payment-sent-button`

- [x] "Pay now in Bitcoin" reveal button — QR and address hidden until the payer clicks through, so they review the invoice first. Auto-reveals for already-detected/paid invoices.
- [x] "Mark as Payment Sent" button opens a dialog that actively polls mempool.space for 60 seconds on a front-loaded tiered schedule (5x2s + 5x3s + 3x5s + 2x10s = 15 polls)
- [x] Dialog states: polling (progress bar + "Cancel" with helper text), detected ("Your payment has been detected" + OK), timed-out (with mempool.space link)
- [x] Detected dialog auto-pops on status transition pending/overdue → payment_detected/paid — even if the payer never clicked "Mark as Payment Sent"
- [x] Progress bar animates to 100% for ~400ms on detection before flipping to the detected view (visual beat for confirmation)
- [x] Background watcher's fallback-polling first-delay cut from 30s to 10s; WebSocket errors now logged to the browser console
- [x] `/invoices` list and `/invoices/[id]` detail page live-update via Supabase Realtime — freelancer's row/page flips alongside the payer's confirmation, no manual refresh required
- [x] `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` set on `public.invoices` (migration `0006`) so UPDATE events carry all column values for reliable Realtime delivery
- [x] Realtime hook explicitly sets `supabase.realtime.setAuth(access_token)` before subscribing to avoid RLS silently dropping events, and falls back to `router.refresh()` on `visibilitychange` as a safety net

**Done when:** A payer has an explicit action that tells them the system is actively checking, with a clear resolution (detected or not-yet-detected with a mempool.space link) within 60 seconds, AND a clear "Your payment has been detected" confirmation appears even if they never clicked the button.

---

### ✅ v1.3.4 — Invoice Duplication

**Branch:** `v1.3.4/invoice-duplication`

- [x] `Duplicate` action on the `/invoices` per-row dropdown (placeholder 🚩 shipped in v1.3.2)
- [x] Server action `duplicateInvoice(id)` — creates a new draft invoice by copying all fields from the source except: `id`, `status` (→ draft), `btc_address` (cleared — addresses can't be reused), `btc_txid` (cleared), `created_at` / `updated_at`. `access_code` persists.
- [x] `invoice_number` behavior: append " (copy)" if source has a number; leave null otherwise
- [x] After duplication, redirect the user to `/invoices/[new-id]/edit`

**Done when:** User can duplicate any invoice into a new draft with a single click.

---

### ✅ v1.3.5 — Dashboard Invoice UX Polish

**Branch:** `v1.3.5/dashboard-invoice-polish`

Small follow-up polish on the owner's dashboard views — the list and the single-invoice detail page. All items are self-contained UI improvements, no schema changes.

**`/invoices` list**
- [x] `Unarchive` action on the per-row dropdown for rows with status `archived` (mirrors the existing `Archive` action, reverses status back to its pre-archive value or a sensible default like `pending`)
- [x] `Clear Selected` button appears above the data table (next to or within the toolbar row) whenever one or more rows are selected; clicking it clears the row-selection state without affecting filters or other UI state

**`/invoices/[id]` dashboard detail page**
- [x] Mirror the `/invoices` per-row dropdown actions as buttons at the bottom of the detail view (status-aware, same conditional logic). Example: Edit (draft only), View public invoice / Copy public link (non-draft), Mark as sent (draft), Mark as paid, Archive / Unarchive, Duplicate, Delete. The existing dropdown stays as-is on the list; this is a second surface for the same actions on the detail page where there is room for explicit buttons.

**Done when:** Archived rows can be restored without leaving the list, selection can be cleared with one click, and every action available from the dropdown is also reachable as an explicit button from the single-invoice view.

---

### ✅ v1.3.6 — Form & Client View Polish

**Branch:** `v1.3.6/form-and-client-view-polish`

Two small, independent input/display-quality fixes bundled because they each touch a single field or component.

**`/invoices/new` form**
- 🚫 ~~Suppress password-manager browser-extension icons on Invoice number / Name / Email / Company fields.~~ _Won't fix: LastPass ignores the standard opt-out signals (`data-lpignore`, `autoComplete="off"`, `data-form-type="other"`) whenever a field's label or id matches one of its autofill categories (name/email/company/number). Attributes alone were shipped and verified in the DOM but LastPass injected the icon anyway. The only reliable workarounds (`type="search"` on identity fields, or swapping `type="email"` for `type="text"`) break HTML semantics and native validation — not worth the tradeoff for one extension's heuristic._

**`/invoice/[id]` public payment view**
- [x] Make the BTC amount copyable — click/tap to copy, with the same "copied" feedback used on the `/invoices/[id]` share-link copy button (`src/components/copy-button.tsx`)
- [x] Make the BTC address copyable with the same pattern

**Done when:** Password-manager icons no longer clutter the New Invoice form on fields where autofill is nonsense, and the payer can copy the BTC amount and address with a single click from the public view.

---

### ✅ v1.4 — PDF Generation + Email Notifications

**Branch:** `v1.4/pdf-and-email`

- [x] On login: sweep all `pending` / `payment_detected` invoices for the user to catch missed events (deferred from v1.3)
- [x] Resend + React Email configured
- [x] Email: invoice link + access code sent to client on publish
- [x] Email: payment detected notification to creator (0-conf)
- [x] Email: payment confirmed notification to creator (1+ conf)
- [x] PDF generation with `@react-pdf/renderer` (server-side)
- [x] PDF download available from invoice detail view

**Done when:** All transactional emails send correctly and PDFs are downloadable.

---

### ⏳ v1.5 — Design System Overhaul

**Branch:** `v1.5/design-system`

> **Block:** Colour scheme decision needed from you before implementation begins. See notes below.

**Colour scheme**
- [ ] DECISION: You to choose new colour scheme — current palette (near-black bg, dark surface, red `#DE3C4B` accent) lacks visual variety and makes it hard to differentiate button intent (e.g. primary action vs destructive vs secondary). New scheme should include at least one additional highlight colour and provide enough contrast between action types.
- [ ] Implement new colour scheme across CSS variables / Tailwind config
- [ ] Audit all buttons and badges to ensure each action type (primary, secondary, destructive, neutral) is visually distinct under the new scheme

**Light / dark mode**
- [ ] Add dark/light mode toggle to the navbar
- [ ] Ensure all components render correctly in both modes (Tailwind `dark:` variants)
- [ ] Persist mode preference to `localStorage`

**Done when:** Colour scheme decision is made and implemented, all button states are visually distinct, and both dark and light mode work correctly throughout the app.

---

### ⏳ v1.6 — Bitcoin Enhancements

**Branch:** `v1.6/btc-enhancements`

- [ ] Optional BTC discount field on invoice creation (% value, e.g. 5%)
- [ ] Discount only applies if the invoice is paid in Bitcoin — shown on the client payment view as a line item reducing the BTC amount
- [ ] Discount displayed on client view alongside the BTC amount (e.g. "5% BTC discount — save $X")
- [ ] Discount not reflected in the fiat total; it is a BTC-payment incentive only

**Done when:** A freelancer can offer a percentage discount to clients who pay in BTC, visible only on the payment view.

---

### ⏳ v1.7 — Address Format Standardisation

**Branch:** `v1.7/address-fields`

> **Note:** This branch changes the address data model. Should land before v2.3 (saved client/sender details) since those features depend on the address structure.

- [ ] Replace single freeform `your_address` / `client_address` text fields with structured fields: Line 1, Line 2, City, State/Province, Post Code, Country — following the UN/OASIS xNAL address standard ordering
- [ ] Schema migration: add individual address sub-columns (nullable); keep old `*_address` column for migration only, then drop after backfill
- [ ] Update invoice form with the new multi-field address layout
- [ ] Update invoice detail page (user view) and client payment view to render the structured address correctly
- [ ] No auto-fill or address lookup required

**Done when:** All address inputs are structured multi-field; old freeform address column removed; views render the structured address neatly.

---

## v2 — Growth (Billing + Ecosystem)

> Goal: Monetise the product and expand the creator experience.

---

### 🚫 v2.0 — Subscription Billing

**Branch:** `v2.0/billing`

- [ ] Lemon Squeezy integration
- [ ] Free tier enforcement: 5 invoices/month cap
- [ ] Paid tier: unlimited invoices
- [ ] BTC one-time payments for 1-month / 6-month / 1-year plans

---

### 🚫 v2.1 — OAuth

**Branch:** `v2.1/oauth`

- [ ] Google OAuth
- [ ] GitHub OAuth
- [ ] LinkedIn OAuth

---

### 🚫 v2.2 — Custom Subdomains + Branding

**Branch:** `v2.2/custom-subdomains`

- [ ] Wildcard subdomain routing (`yourcompany.paybitty.io`)
- [ ] Logo/branding upload (paid tier only)

---

### 🚫 v2.3 — Address Book + Reusable Items

**Branch:** `v2.3/address-book`

> **Depends on:** v1.7 (address format standardisation) — saved addresses use the structured multi-field format.

**Saved client details**
- [ ] User can save up to 5 client profiles (name, email, company, structured address, tax ID)
- [ ] Client selector on invoice creation form — choosing a saved client pre-fills all client fields
- [ ] Manage saved clients: add, edit, delete from a settings or clients page

**Saved sender (own) details**
- [ ] User can save one set of their own invoicing details (name, email, company, structured address, tax ID)
- [ ] "Your details" section on invoice creation pre-fills from saved profile if one exists
- [ ] User can update their saved details from settings

**Reusable items**
- [ ] Reusable service/line item templates

---

### 🚫 v2.4 — Multi-Currency Support

**Branch:** `v2.4/multi-currency`

- [ ] Currency selector on invoice creation (USD, EUR, GBP, AUD, CAD, etc.)
- [ ] BTC price fetched in the selected fiat currency
- [ ] Dashboard shows currency alongside invoice totals

---

## Notes

- Billing (v2.0+) is fully deferred until v1 is stable and in use.
- xpub / HD wallet support is permanently rejected — security risk if the key leaks.
- Light mode and colour scheme overhaul are tracked in v1.5.

---

## Pre-deployment Checklist

Project is not yet linked to Vercel. Before first deployment, run `vercel link` and mirror all `.env` values into Vercel project env vars (Production, Preview, Development):

- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- [ ] `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (if used server-side)
- [ ] `RESEND_API_KEY` (added v1.4)
- [ ] **Verify a sending domain in the Resend dashboard** and set `EMAIL_FROM` to an address on that domain. Without a verified domain, Resend only delivers to the email address on the Resend account itself — sends to any other recipient (clients, test addresses) return a 422 and the email never arrives. This is a Resend free-tier safety rail, not a Paybitty bug.
- [ ] Any other secrets present in `.env` at deploy time
