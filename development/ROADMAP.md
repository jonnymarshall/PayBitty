## v1 — MVP (Core BTC Invoicing)

> Goal: A working product a freelancer can use today. Create an invoice, share it, get paid in BTC.

---

### ✅ v1.0 — Project Foundation

**Branch:** `v1.0/foundation`

- [x] Next.js App Router project with TypeScript
- [x] Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui dark theme configured (bg `#0A0A0A`, surface `#181818`, accent `#DE3C4B`)
- [x] Supabase project linked; `invoices` table + enums + RLS policies
- [x] Magic link auth via Supabase Auth
- [x] Auth proxy (proxy.ts, Next.js 16) protecting `/dashboard` and related routes
- [x] Basic layout: navbar, authenticated shell

**Done when:** A user can sign in via magic link and land on an empty dashboard.

---

### ✅ v1.1 — Invoice CRUD + Dashboard

**Branch:** `v1.1/invoice-crud`

- [x] Invoice creation form: client name, client email, line items, optional tax, due date, BTC address
- [x] BTC address uniqueness validation (no reuse across non-draft invoices)
- [x] Save as draft
- [x] Publish invoice: generates 8-char alphanumeric access code + shareable link
- [x] Dashboard: list all invoices with status badge (draft, pending, payment_detected, paid, overdue)
- [x] Delete draft invoice
- [x] Mark invoice as overdue (manual)

**Done when:** A freelancer can create, publish, and manage invoices from their dashboard.

---

### ✅ v1.1.1 — Invoice Form Improvements

**Branch:** `fix/invoice-form-improvements`

**Schema changes**
- [x] Add `invoice_number` (text, nullable) to invoices table
- [x] Replace `tax_fiat` with `tax_percent` (numeric, default 0) — store as %, compute fiat at save time
- [x] Add sender fields: `your_name`, `your_email`, `your_company`, `your_address`, `your_tax_id` (all text, nullable)
- [x] Add client fields: `client_company`, `client_address`, `client_tax_id` (all text, nullable)
- [x] Add `accepts_bitcoin` (boolean, default false)
- [x] Change `access_code` to be nullable and user-set (no auto-generation)
- [x] Add `btc_address` nullable when `accepts_bitcoin` is false

**Form UX**
- [x] Split form header: "YOU" (left) / "CLIENT" (right) with full sender + client fields
- [x] Invoice number field (freeform text, max 50 chars)
- [x] Tax field: percent input (%), compute fiat on save
- [x] Due date: shadcn date picker + "No due date" toggle
- [x] Quantity and unit price: freeform (empty = 0 on submit), max qty 100,000 / max unit price 1,000,000,000, 2 decimal places, no spinner arrows
- [x] "Accept Bitcoin" toggle — shows BTC address field only when enabled
- [x] Access code: user-set text field OR "No access code" toggle (no auto-generation)
- [x] Remove red asterisks from all fields
- [x] Email validation (valid format if entered, not required)

**Invoice detail page**
- [x] Mark as paid button (manual, for non-BTC or already-confirmed payments)
- [x] Edit draft button → pre-populated edit form (same as new invoice form)
- [x] Fix share link: show full URL (`http://...`), add copy button with copied feedback
- [x] Fix route: `/invoice/[id]` public route stub (placeholder until v1.2)

**Done when:** All form feedback addressed, draft editing works, share link copies correctly.

---

### ✅ v1.1.2 — Invoice Form Polish

**Branch:** `fix/invoice-form-improvements` (continued)

- [x] Form too left-aligned — remove `max-w-2xl` constraint, let dashboard width govern
- [x] Add visual gap/separator between YOU and CLIENT columns
- [x] Line items: rewrite with flex rows (grid arbitrary values unreliable), keep no-spinners + allow empty
- [x] Tax % input: replace absolute-positioned `%` with inline flex suffix; remove spinners
- [x] Date picker: widens automatically once form width is fixed
- [x] Access code: remove checkbox, single optional input labelled "Access code (Optional)"
- [x] Remove client name as a required field — all client fields optional

**Done when:** Form looks balanced, line items are horizontal, tax field is clean, access code is simplified.

---

### ✅ v1.1.3 — Invoice Form Layout & Validation Fixes

**Branch:** `fix/invoice-form-improvements` (continued)

**Layout**
- [x] Fix YOU/CLIENT sections — columns side-by-side with centred divider and clear gap (inline styles to work around Tailwind v4 gap/padding generation bug)
- [x] Line items: column headers (Description, Qty, Unit price) in same div as their inputs — mirrors Field pattern, labels only on first row, subsequent rows align underneath
- [x] Line items: use inline `gap` style so column widths are consistent across all rows
- [x] Dynamic page title — reverted; title stays as static "New Invoice" / "Edit Invoice"
- [x] Remove Tax % suffix element — label now reads "Tax (%)" instead

**Validation & input behaviour**
- [x] Email validation: only validates format if an email is entered; blank is allowed for both sender and client
- [x] Allow "0" as a valid quantity or unit price (tracked as raw string; zero no longer collapses to empty display)
- [x] Invoice number: max 50 characters enforced via `maxLength` attribute and validation
- [x] Qty field: no placeholder after deletion — field is blank when empty, no greyed "1" re-appearing
- [x] Qty / Unit price inputs changed to `type="text" inputMode="decimal"` — eliminates spinners, scroll-wheel changes, and arrow-key increments entirely
- [x] Tax input likewise changed to `type="text" inputMode="decimal"`
- [x] Fix `client_email` / `your_email` NOT NULL constraint — send empty string instead of null when blank
- [x] New line items added via "+ Add line item" now prefill qty with "1" (matching the initial row)

**Done when:** YOU and CLIENT sit side by side with a centre divider; column headers align with their inputs; all input behaviour matches spec above.

---

### ✅ v1.1.4 — Invoice UX Polish

**Branch:** `fix/invoice-form-improvements` (continued)

**Routing**
- [x] `/invoices` route shows the invoice list (same as `/dashboard`); `/dashboard` redirects to `/invoices`

**Invoice form**
- [x] Remove `heading-invoice-title` element from the invoice form — title lives on the page, not inside the form component
- [x] Close vertical space between field rows within YOU and CLIENT sections
- [x] Scroll page to first failed validation field when a form submission fails validation
- [x] Stop `client_name` defaulting to "Unnamed" when left blank — allow empty
- [x] Cancel button at the bottom of the edit invoice form; if the form is dirty, show a confirmation modal before discarding changes

**Invoice detail page**
- [x] Fix centering — detail page content is left-aligned within the wide layout container; add `mx-auto`
- [x] Replace client name in the large header with the invoice number; remove the smaller inline invoice number beside it
- [x] Add "Mark as unpaid" action for paid invoices (reverts status to pending)

**Done when:** All items above are checked off.

---

### ✅ v1.1.5 — Form Validation, Nav & Date Picker

**Branch:** `fix/invoice-form-improvements` (continued)

**Routing & nav**
- [x] Navbar "Paybitty" logo text links to home (`/invoices`)

**Form validation hardening**
- [x] Qty field: enforce max 100,000 and max 2 decimal places (validate on submit, not on keystroke)
- [x] Unit price field: enforce max 1,000,000,000 and max 2 decimal places (validate on submit)

**Date picker**
- [x] Replace current narrow date picker with the correctly-sized shadcn date picker matching the component docs (proper popover width, calendar styling)

**ID coverage**
- [x] Create a reusable `add-ids` skill that audits the UI and adds appropriately named `id` attributes to all key elements
- [x] Run the skill across all pages and components so every interactive and structural element has a stable ID

**Done when:** Nav logo navigates home, validation rejects out-of-range qty/price, date picker matches shadcn docs, all key elements have IDs.

---

### ✅ v1.2 — Client Payment View + BTC QR Code

**Branch:** `v1.2/client-payment-view`

> Note: `/invoice/[id]` currently shows a "Client payment view coming soon" stub. This branch replaces it with the full implementation.

- [x] Public route `/invoice/[id]` with access code gate
- [x] BTC price fetching API: `GET /api/btc-price?currency=USD` (Coinbase primary, CoinGecko fallback, ~60s server-side cache)
- [x] BTC amount computed from live price at view time
- [x] BIP21 QR code generated (`bitcoin:<address>?amount=<btc>&label=<label>`)
- [x] Client view: invoice details, fiat total, BTC amount, QR code

**Also fixed on this branch**
- [x] BTC address conflict error: shows inline below field (not top of form), scrolls to field, friendly message naming the conflicting invoice
- [x] BTC conflict check covers all non-draft statuses (was only checking `pending`; DB index covers all)
- [x] Centralised `parseServerError()` utility — error message wording lives in one place
- [x] Conflict error falls back to short invoice ID (`…xxxxxxxx`) when conflicting invoice has no number

**Done when:** A client can open a link, enter an access code, see the invoice, and scan a QR code to pay.

---

### ✅ v1.3 — Payment Detection

**Branch:** `v1.3/payment-detection`

- [x] mempool.space WebSocket connection opened client-side on the payment view page
- [x] 0-conf event: update invoice status to `payment_detected`
- [x] 1-conf event: update invoice status to `paid`
- [x] Fallback: exponential backoff polling (30s start, doubles, caps ~10min)
- [x] WebSocket closed once invoice reaches `paid`
- [x] Real-time status UI update on client payment page
- [x] `btc_txid` saved when payment is detected or confirmed; displayed in both user and client views as a link to mempool.space
- [x] BTC address validation — checksum-verified (bech32, bech32m, base58check) on both client form and server action; invalid addresses blocked at publish time

> **Deferred to v1.4:** On-login sweep of all `pending` / `payment_detected` invoices — detected payments are caught when any relevant invoice page is viewed, which covers the common case. A background sweep at login will be added in v1.4 alongside email notifications (same session).

**Done when:** Payment detection works end-to-end with live and fallback paths; invalid BTC addresses are rejected at publish time.

---

### ✅ v1.3.1 — Invoice View & List Date Polish

**Branch:** `v1.3.1/invoice-date-polish`

- [x] Invoice detail page (user view): add "Date Sent" (created/published date) and "Date Due" — currently shows no date information
- [x] Client payment view: already shows "Due" date — add "Date Sent" alongside it for full context
- [x] `/invoices` list: replace creation date with due date; label it "Due \<date\>" to avoid ambiguity (invoices with no due date show a dash or nothing)

**Done when:** Both views clearly surface sent and due dates; the invoice list shows due date with unambiguous label.

---

### ✅ v1.3.2 — Invoice List Management

**Branch:** `v1.3.2/invoice-list-management`

- [x] Multi-select checkboxes on the `/invoices` list
- [x] Bulk action dropdown appears when one or more invoices are selected: Delete, Archive, Mark as Paid
- [x] Archive status: add `archived` to invoice status enum; archived invoices hidden from main list by default (consider a toggle to show them)
- [x] Bulk delete: confirm before executing; only draft invoices deletable in bulk (or confirm for non-draft)
- [x] Bulk mark as paid: applies to selected non-paid invoices

**Done when:** User can select multiple invoices and apply bulk actions from a single dropdown.

---

### ✅ v1.3.3 — Payment Sent Button & Reveal Gate

**Branch:** `v1.3.3/payment-sent-button`

- [x] "Pay now in Bitcoin" reveal button — QR and address hidden until the payer clicks through, so they review the invoice first. Auto-reveals for already-detected/paid invoices.
- [x] "Mark as Payment Sent" button opens a dialog that actively polls mempool.space for 60 seconds on a front-loaded tiered schedule (5x2s + 5x3s + 3x5s + 2x10s = 15 polls)
- [x] Dialog states: polling (progress bar + "Cancel" with helper text), detected ("Your payment has been detected" + OK), timed-out (with mempool.space link)
- [x] Detected dialog auto-pops on status transition pending/overdue → payment_detected/paid — even if the payer never clicked "Mark as Payment Sent"
- [x] Progress bar animates to 100% for ~400ms on detection before flipping to the detected view (visual beat for confirmation)
- [x] Background watcher's fallback-polling first-delay cut from 30s to 10s; WebSocket errors now logged to the browser console
- [x] `/invoices` list and `/invoices/[id]` detail page live-update via Supabase Realtime — freelancer's row/page flips alongside the payer's confirmation, no manual refresh required
- [x] `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` set on `public.invoices` (migration `0006`) so UPDATE events carry all column values for reliable Realtime delivery
- [x] Realtime hook explicitly sets `supabase.realtime.setAuth(access_token)` before subscribing to avoid RLS silently dropping events, and falls back to `router.refresh()` on `visibilitychange` as a safety net

**Done when:** A payer has an explicit action that tells them the system is actively checking, with a clear resolution (detected or not-yet-detected with a mempool.space link) within 60 seconds, AND a clear "Your payment has been detected" confirmation appears even if they never clicked the button.

---

### ✅ v1.3.4 — Invoice Duplication

**Branch:** `v1.3.4/invoice-duplication`

- [x] `Duplicate` action on the `/invoices` per-row dropdown (placeholder 🚩 shipped in v1.3.2)
- [x] Server action `duplicateInvoice(id)` — creates a new draft invoice by copying all fields from the source except: `id`, `status` (→ draft), `btc_address` (cleared — addresses can't be reused), `btc_txid` (cleared), `created_at` / `updated_at`. `access_code` persists.
- [x] `invoice_number` behavior: append " (copy)" if source has a number; leave null otherwise
- [x] After duplication, redirect the user to `/invoices/[new-id]/edit`

**Done when:** User can duplicate any invoice into a new draft with a single click.

---

### ✅ v1.3.5 — Dashboard Invoice UX Polish

**Branch:** `v1.3.5/dashboard-invoice-polish`

Small follow-up polish on the owner's dashboard views — the list and the single-invoice detail page. All items are self-contained UI improvements, no schema changes.

**`/invoices` list**
- [x] `Unarchive` action on the per-row dropdown for rows with status `archived` (mirrors the existing `Archive` action, reverses status back to its pre-archive value or a sensible default like `pending`)
- [x] `Clear Selected` button appears above the data table (next to or within the toolbar row) whenever one or more rows are selected; clicking it clears the row-selection state without affecting filters or other UI state

**`/invoices/[id]` dashboard detail page**
- [x] Mirror the `/invoices` per-row dropdown actions as buttons at the bottom of the detail view (status-aware, same conditional logic). Example: Edit (draft only), View public invoice / Copy public link (non-draft), Mark as sent (draft), Mark as paid, Archive / Unarchive, Duplicate, Delete. The existing dropdown stays as-is on the list; this is a second surface for the same actions on the detail page where there is room for explicit buttons.

**Done when:** Archived rows can be restored without leaving the list, selection can be cleared with one click, and every action available from the dropdown is also reachable as an explicit button from the single-invoice view.

---

### ✅ v1.3.6 — Form & Client View Polish

**Branch:** `v1.3.6/form-and-client-view-polish`

Two small, independent input/display-quality fixes bundled because they each touch a single field or component.

**`/invoices/new` form**
- 🚫 ~~Suppress password-manager browser-extension icons on Invoice number / Name / Email / Company fields.~~ _Won't fix: LastPass ignores the standard opt-out signals (`data-lpignore`, `autoComplete="off"`, `data-form-type="other"`) whenever a field's label or id matches one of its autofill categories (name/email/company/number). Attributes alone were shipped and verified in the DOM but LastPass injected the icon anyway. The only reliable workarounds (`type="search"` on identity fields, or swapping `type="email"` for `type="text"`) break HTML semantics and native validation — not worth the tradeoff for one extension's heuristic._

**`/invoice/[id]` public payment view**
- [x] Make the BTC amount copyable — click/tap to copy, with the same "copied" feedback used on the `/invoices/[id]` share-link copy button (`src/components/copy-button.tsx`)
- [x] Make the BTC address copyable with the same pattern

**Done when:** Password-manager icons no longer clutter the New Invoice form on fields where autofill is nonsense, and the payer can copy the BTC amount and address with a single click from the public view.

---

### ✅ v1.4 — PDF Generation + Email Notifications

**Branch:** `v1.4/pdf-and-email`

- [x] On login: sweep all `pending` / `payment_detected` invoices for the user to catch missed events (deferred from v1.3)
- [x] Resend + React Email configured
- [x] Email: invoice link + access code sent to client on publish
- [x] Email: payment detected notification to creator (0-conf)
- [x] Email: payment confirmed notification to creator (1+ conf)
- [x] PDF generation with `@react-pdf/renderer` (server-side)
- [x] PDF download available from invoice detail view
- [x] Log out button in the dashboard nav (right of the user email) — needed for testing sign-in with a different account during email deliverability checks

**Done when:** All transactional emails send correctly and PDFs are downloadable.

---

### ✅ v1.4.1 — Background Payment Polling (replaces login sweep)

**Branch:** `v1.4.1/background-payment-polling`

**Context for a fresh session:** v1.4 shipped two payment-detection paths: (a) a client-side mempool WebSocket watcher on `/invoice/[id]` that catches transitions in real time while the payer is on the page, and (b) a login-time "sweep" (`src/components/login-sweep-trigger.tsx` + `src/app/(dashboard)/sweep-action.ts`) that catches missed transitions when the owner next opens the dashboard. Both leave a gap: if the payer closes the page *and* the owner doesn't log in, nothing runs. This version replaces the login sweep with a **Vercel Cron** that polls mempool.space on a per-invoice schedule, so detection is fully background — no user presence required on either side.

**Polling schedule (user-confirmed):**

- **Pre-mempool (status = `pending`, nothing broadcast yet):** 1m, 5m, 10m, 30m after publish. If still not seen after ~46 min, background polling stops for that invoice. Client-side watcher still works if the payer returns to the page.
- **Post-mempool (status = `payment_detected`, tx seen but unconfirmed):** 10m × 3, then 1h × 6, then 4h × 12, then 8h × 24. After ~11 days unconfirmed, stop.

**Login sweep is removed entirely** — the background cron becomes the single source of truth.

---

#### Schema — new migration `supabase/migrations/0008_background_payment_schedule.sql`

Add three columns to `invoices`:

- `next_check_at TIMESTAMPTZ` (nullable) — when the cron should next process this row. `NULL` = no polling (draft, paid, archived, or exhausted).
- `mempool_seen_at TIMESTAMPTZ` (nullable) — when the tx was first seen in mempool. Drives the post-mempool cadence.
- `stage_attempt INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` — counter within the current stage. Interval = fn(mempool_seen_at IS NULL, stage_attempt).

Partial index on `next_check_at WHERE next_check_at IS NOT NULL` for fast cron lookups.

Backfill: existing `pending`/`payment_detected` rows get `next_check_at = now() + interval '1 minute'` so they pick up on first cron run.

#### New pure scheduling function — `src/lib/invoices/payment-schedule.ts`

```ts
interface ScheduleInput {
  status: "pending" | "payment_detected";
  btc_address: string;
  mempool_seen_at: string | null;
  stage_attempt: number;
}

interface ScheduleDecision {
  newStatus: "pending" | "payment_detected" | "paid";
  newMempoolSeenAt: string | null;
  newStageAttempt: number;
  newNextCheckAt: string | null; // null = stop polling
  detectedTxid: string | null;   // non-null if status changed this tick
}

function decidePaymentSchedule(
  input: ScheduleInput,
  txs: MempoolTx[],
  now: Date
): ScheduleDecision
```

Pure function, no I/O. Replaces the core decision logic currently inside `sweepUserInvoices`. Fully unit-tested.

Delay table (hardcoded, easy to tweak):

```ts
const PRE_MEMPOOL_DELAYS_MS = [60_000, 300_000, 600_000, 1_800_000]; // 1m, 5m, 10m, 30m
const POST_MEMPOOL_STAGES = [
  { count: 3,  intervalMs: 10 * 60_000 },
  { count: 6,  intervalMs: 60 * 60_000 },
  { count: 12, intervalMs: 4 * 60 * 60_000 },
  { count: 24, intervalMs: 8 * 60 * 60_000 },
];
```

#### New cron endpoint — `src/app/api/cron/payment-sweep/route.ts`

Behavior:
1. Require `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET` — 401 otherwise. Vercel Cron attaches this header automatically.
2. Fetch up to 50 invoices where `next_check_at <= now()` AND `status IN ('pending','payment_detected')`.
3. For each: `fetchAddressTxs(btc_address)` (existing helper in `src/lib/mempool.ts`), pass to `decidePaymentSchedule`, apply update with optimistic concurrency (`.eq("status", current.status)`).
4. If status transitioned: dispatch via existing `sendPaymentDetectedEmail` / `sendPaymentConfirmedEmail` (resolve owner email via `supabase.auth.admin.getUserById`, same pattern as `src/app/api/invoices/[id]/payment-status/route.ts`).
5. Return JSON `{ processed, transitions, errors }` for Vercel Cron logs.

Batch cap (50) protects against mempool.space rate limits (~10/s).

#### Vercel cron config — new `vercel.json` at repo root

```json
{
  "crons": [
    { "path": "/api/cron/payment-sweep", "schedule": "* * * * *" }
  ]
}
```

Every minute. Vercel's current policy (2025) supports per-minute cron on Hobby with up to 2 crons.

#### Payment-status route — consolidate shared logic

`src/app/api/invoices/[id]/payment-status/route.ts` currently has near-duplicate transition logic. After the route's existing txid validation, replace its ad-hoc status-update block with a call into a thin wrapper around `decidePaymentSchedule` (or a helper that accepts a known txid rather than raw mempool txs). The route still exists — it's the fast path when the client-side watcher fires — but it now shares one schedule / one state-update shape with the cron.

#### Files to DELETE (login sweep removal)

- `src/components/login-sweep-trigger.tsx`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/sweep-action.ts`
- `src/lib/invoices/sweep.ts` + `sweep.test.ts` (logic moves to `payment-schedule.ts`)

#### Files to EDIT

- `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` — remove `<LoginSweepTrigger />` and its import.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/invoices/actions.ts` — in `publishInvoice`, after setting status to `pending`, also set `next_check_at = now() + 1 minute`, `stage_attempt = 0`, `mempool_seen_at = null`.
- `src/app/api/invoices/[id]/payment-status/route.ts` — consolidate per above.
- `development/ROADMAP.md` — flip this section ⏳ → ✅ when done; add `CRON_SECRET` to the pre-deployment checklist.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — add v1.4.1 entry.

#### Tests

New:
- `src/lib/invoices/payment-schedule.test.ts` — high coverage; this is the core logic:
  - Pre-mempool attempt 0 → next interval 5m.
  - Pre-mempool attempt 3 (final) with no tx → `next_check_at = null` (stop).
  - Pre-mempool attempt with unconfirmed tx → transition to `payment_detected`, `mempool_seen_at` set, `stage_attempt = 0`, `next_check_at = +10m`.
  - Pre-mempool attempt with confirmed tx → transition to `paid`, `next_check_at = null`.
  - Post-mempool attempt 2 (end of 10m stage) → next interval 1h.
  - Post-mempool attempt 8 (end of 1h stage) → next interval 4h.
  - Post-mempool attempt 44 (final) with still-unconfirmed tx → `next_check_at = null` (stop).
  - Post-mempool attempt with confirmed tx → transition to `paid`, `next_check_at = null`.
- `src/app/api/cron/payment-sweep.test.ts` (route-level):
  - 401 when bearer missing / wrong.
  - Correct scope: `.eq("status", "pending"/"payment_detected")`, `.lte("next_check_at", now())`, `.limit(50)`.
  - Emails dispatched exactly once per transition (mock `@/lib/email/send` same way `payment-status.test.ts` does).

Update:
- `src/app/(dashboard)/invoices/actions.test.ts` — `publishInvoice` tests should assert `next_check_at`, `stage_attempt`, `mempool_seen_at` are written.

Delete:
- `src/lib/invoices/sweep.test.ts` (the sweep it tests is being removed).

All remaining tests should continue to pass. Typecheck + lint clean.

#### Manual-test affordance for dev

In dev, Vercel Cron doesn't fire. Curl the endpoint with the secret:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" http://localhost:3000/api/cron/payment-sweep
```

Document this at the top of the route file.

#### Pre-deployment additions

Add to the "Pre-deployment Checklist" section at the bottom of this roadmap:
- `CRON_SECRET` — required by the cron endpoint. Vercel generates this when you configure the cron; mirror it into `.env.local` for dev curl.

**Done when:** A testnet invoice, published and then immediately abandoned (payer closes the tab), still transitions to `payment_detected` and then `paid` on the correct mempool events — with the creator receiving both emails — without anyone logging in.

> **Followup validation (not yet performed):** end-to-end tested on testnet4 only. A mainnet dry-run with a real BTC address is still outstanding — set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BTC_NETWORK=mainnet` in `.env`, restart the dev server, publish an invoice with a real receive address, and confirm the same `pending → payment_detected → paid` flow runs through the cron without code changes. An earlier attempt against a mainnet address failed silently, most likely because the network env var was still pointing at testnet4.

### ✅ v1.4.2 — Public Payer Page Live Updates

**Branch:** `v1.4.2/public-invoice-realtime`

**Context:** In v1.4.1, the background cron (and the existing fast-path `/api/invoices/[id]/payment-status` route) can both transition an invoice's status without the payer's page knowing. The public `/invoice/[id]` page currently has no Supabase Realtime subscription — it only updates via its own mempool.space WebSocket (while the tab is open) or via server-render on first load. If the cron flips `pending → payment_detected` while the payer is looking at the page, the badge won't move until they refresh.

**Scope**
- [x] Add a Supabase Realtime subscription to `src/app/invoice/[id]/invoice-payment-view.tsx` (or a small hook like `use-public-invoice-realtime.ts`) that listens for UPDATEs on the `invoices` table filtered to the specific invoice id, and applies them to local state.
- [x] Subscribe with the anon key (not the user session — payer is unauthenticated on this page). Confirm RLS allows a SELECT on the row scoped by id + access_code, or add a permissive SELECT policy specifically for Realtime if needed. `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` is already set (migration 0006) so UPDATE events carry full rows.
- [x] Keep the existing mempool.space WebSocket watcher — it's still the fastest path when the payer is on the page. Realtime is the fallback for cron-driven transitions.
- [x] Add `visibilitychange` → `router.refresh()` safety net (same pattern as the dashboard hook).
- [x] Unit-test the new hook the same way `use-invoice-realtime.test.ts` tests the dashboard one.

**Done when:** With the payer's page open and no mempool-side connection activity, running the cron (or calling the fast-path API from a different client) immediately flips the status badge on the payer's page without a refresh.

**Also update the README when this ships:**
- [x] In `README.md` → "Payment detection architecture" → summary table, remove the callout under the table that says path (C) changes won't reach the payer without a refresh. That disclaimer exists specifically because of the v1.4.1 gap this branch closes.
- [x] Extend the "(D) Owner live updates" section (or add a new "(E) Payer live updates" section) documenting that the public `/invoice/[id]` page now subscribes to Supabase Realtime too, including the anon-key / RLS note.

---

### ✅ v1.4.3 — Email Event Log (DB-backed)

**Branch:** `v1.4.3/email-events-log`

**Context:** v1.4 added three transactional emails (invoice published, payment detected, payment confirmed), and v1.4.1 added a second callsite for the payment emails (the background cron). Today there is **no persistent record** that any of these were sent — evidence only lives in Resend's dashboard and transient runtime logs. If a payer reports never receiving an invoice link, or an owner claims they never got a payment-confirmed email, there is no in-app way to answer *"was it sent, when, and did it succeed?"* This branch closes that gap.

**Checklist:**
- [x] Migration `0010_email_events.sql` (renumbered from 0009 — that slot was taken by v1.4.2's anon-select policy): enums, table, indexes, RLS, owner-read policy
- [x] `src/lib/email/send.test.ts` covers queued→sent, skipped_no_api_key, failed-with-error-message, and DB-write-failure-doesn't-throw
- [x] `safeSend` refactored to take `EmailContext { invoiceId, userId, type, recipient }` and write `email_events`
- [x] All three `sendXxxEmail` functions build and pass `EmailContext`
- [x] `publishInvoice` passes `invoice.user_id`; existing test asserts `userId: "user-1"`
- [x] `payment-status` route passes `invoice.user_id`; existing test asserts `userId: "owner-1"`
- [x] `payment-sweep` cron passes `inv.user_id`; existing test asserts `userId: "owner-1"`
- [x] **Email Activity** card on `/invoices/[id]` (server component fetching `email_events` for the invoice)
- [x] README "Email event log" + "What is *still not* tracked" sections rewritten
- [x] CHANGELOG v1.4.3 entry
- [x] Manual test guide: `manual-tests/v1.4.3-email-events-log.md` (6 tests + 90s smoke)
- [x] ROADMAP flipped to ✅

**Notes / deviations from the original spec:**
- Migration filename is `0010_email_events.sql`, not `0009_email_events.sql` (the `0009` slot was taken by v1.4.2's anon-select policy).
- Failed-row error rendering: spec said *"error message on hover"* (native `title` tooltip). Implementation surfaces the error **inline in red text below the row** instead — discoverable without hover, accessible to keyboard and screen-reader users.
- Realtime auto-refresh of the activity card is **not wired up** (deferred). The existing v1.3.3 invoice realtime hook only refetches the invoice row, not its email events. Loading the page or any normal navigation re-fetches them server-side.

---

#### Schema — new migration `supabase/migrations/0009_email_events.sql`

```sql
create type email_type as enum (
  'invoice_published',
  'payment_detected',
  'payment_confirmed'
);

create type email_event_status as enum (
  'queued',
  'sent',
  'failed',
  'skipped_no_api_key'
);

create table email_events (
  id              uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  invoice_id      uuid not null references invoices(id) on delete cascade,
  user_id         uuid not null references auth.users(id) on delete cascade,
  email_type      email_type not null,
  recipient       text not null,
  status          email_event_status not null default 'queued',
  resend_message_id text,              -- populated from Resend's response on success
  error_message   text,                -- populated on 'failed'
  created_at      timestamptz not null default now(),
  updated_at      timestamptz not null default now()
);

create index email_events_invoice_id_idx on email_events (invoice_id, created_at desc);
create index email_events_user_id_idx    on email_events (user_id, created_at desc);

alter table email_events enable row level security;

create policy "owner can read own email events"
  on email_events for select
  using (auth.uid() = user_id);
-- Inserts/updates only happen server-side via the service role key; no anon insert policy.
```

`user_id` is denormalised from the invoice row so the RLS policy is a simple `auth.uid() = user_id` check rather than a join.

---

#### `safeSend` refactor — `src/lib/email/send.ts`

Current signature wraps a closure; new signature passes context so the wrapper can write to `email_events`:

```ts
interface EmailContext {
  invoiceId: string;
  userId: string;
  type: EmailType;
  recipient: string;
}

async function safeSend(ctx: EmailContext, send: () => Promise<{ id: string }>): Promise<void> {
  const admin = createAdminClient();
  const { data: row } = await admin
    .from("email_events")
    .insert({
      invoice_id: ctx.invoiceId,
      user_id: ctx.userId,
      email_type: ctx.type,
      recipient: ctx.recipient,
      status: "queued",
    })
    .select("id")
    .single();

  if (!getResend()) {
    await admin.from("email_events").update({ status: "skipped_no_api_key" }).eq("id", row!.id);
    console.warn(`[email] skipping ${ctx.type} — RESEND_API_KEY not set`);
    return;
  }

  try {
    const { id: resendId } = await send();
    await admin.from("email_events").update({
      status: "sent",
      resend_message_id: resendId,
      updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
    }).eq("id", row!.id);
  } catch (err) {
    const message = err instanceof Error ? err.message : String(err);
    await admin.from("email_events").update({
      status: "failed",
      error_message: message.slice(0, 500),
      updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
    }).eq("id", row!.id);
    console.error(`[email] ${ctx.type} failed`, err);
  }
}
```

- All three `sendXxxEmail` functions in `src/lib/email/send.ts` are updated to build an `EmailContext` and pass it through.
- `publishInvoice` and both payment callsites pass `invoice.user_id` (for `invoice_published` this is the owner's id, even though the recipient is the payer — the log is owner-scoped for RLS).
- The DB write is best-effort (same philosophy as the email itself): if the admin client fails, log and continue. Never block the parent flow.

---

#### Minimal UI — invoice detail page

On `src/app/(dashboard)/invoices/[id]/page.tsx`, add a small collapsible **"Email activity"** card below the existing actions:

- Lists every `email_events` row for the invoice, most recent first.
- Each row renders: type (human-readable), recipient, status badge (sent / queued / failed / skipped), timestamp, error message on hover if `failed`.
- No pagination — invoices will have at most a handful of rows.

Server component, fetched inline — no client-side polling needed. If a row is still `queued` when the page loads, the Realtime subscription from v1.3.3 already fires `router.refresh()` on invoice row changes; we can extend it to also refresh on `email_events` inserts/updates, or simply leave a "click to refresh" affordance.

---

#### Tests

Update:
- `src/app/(dashboard)/invoices/actions.test.ts` — assert an `email_events` row is inserted with `type='invoice_published'` and eventually marked `sent` on a successful publish.
- `src/app/api/invoices/payment-status.test.ts` — assert event rows for `payment_detected` / `payment_confirmed` transitions.
- `src/app/api/cron/payment-sweep.test.ts` — same assertions for cron-driven transitions.

New:
- `src/lib/email/send.test.ts` — unit tests for `safeSend`: queued-then-sent happy path; skipped when no API key; failed with error message captured; DB write failure doesn't throw.

---

#### Files to EDIT

- `src/lib/email/send.ts` — `safeSend` refactor + context plumbing.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/invoices/actions.ts` — pass `user_id` to `sendInvoicePublishedEmail`.
- `src/app/api/invoices/[id]/payment-status/route.ts` — pass `user_id` to the payment email calls.
- `src/app/api/cron/payment-sweep/route.ts` — same.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/invoices/[id]/page.tsx` — render the email activity card.
- `README.md` — rewrite the **"What is *not* tracked"** sub-section to describe the new table; mention the Resend dashboard as the complementary source for webhook-level data (bounces, complaints) that is not captured yet.
- `development/ROADMAP.md` — flip this section ⏳ → ✅.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — v1.4.3 entry.

---

#### Out of scope (deferred)

- **Resend webhooks** (delivered / bounced / complained events). Would go into a follow-up (e.g. v1.4.4) as a `POST /api/webhooks/resend` endpoint that updates `email_events` rows by `resend_message_id`. Useful but not required to answer the original *"did it send?"* question.
- **Admin-wide email console.** Per-invoice is enough for v1.4.3. A tenant-wide deliverability view is a v2 concern.
- **Retry of failed sends.** No queue infra yet. Leave `status='failed'` as terminal; manual resend is an explicit action.

**Done when:** every email the system sends (or skips) has a corresponding `email_events` row, visible from the invoice detail page to the owner, with status and error messaging surfaced. The README accurately describes the log.

---

### ✅ v1.4.4 — Email Recipient Expansion + Sender Identity

**Branch:** `v1.4.4/email-recipient-and-sender`

**Context:** Today the payment-detected / payment-confirmed emails go to the invoice owner only; the payer never hears back by email after paying. The payer only sees confirmation on the public invoice page they paid through, which is gone the moment they close the tab. Separately, the Resend transactional sender (`EMAIL_FROM`) and the Supabase auth SMTP sender are not aligned — users get magic links from one `From:` and invoice emails from another. Both go out as part of this branch.

**Scope**
- [x] `sendPaymentDetectedEmail` and `sendPaymentConfirmedEmail` — send to **both** the owner and the payer (`client_email`). Two separate Resend calls per transition (keeps per-recipient personalisation simple; `safeSend` already handles failures per-call). Skip the payer-side send if `client_email` is blank, same rule as `sendInvoicePublishedEmail`.
- [x] Consider distinct email copy per recipient — the owner wants "Your client paid invoice X"; the payer wants "Your payment to Y has been detected / confirmed". Two template variants or one template parameterised by role. Prefer template variants for clarity.
- [x] Update `src/lib/email/templates/payment-detected.tsx` and `payment-confirmed.tsx` accordingly — or split into `-owner`/`-payer` files.
- [x] Update all three email callsites (`publishInvoice`, fast-path payment-status route, cron sweep) to dispatch both recipients where applicable.
- [x] Unify sender identity: set `EMAIL_FROM="SatSend <team@mail.satsend.me>"` in `.env` and the Vercel env vars, and change the Supabase custom SMTP sender (dashboard → Auth → SMTP Settings → Sender) to the same address. No code change is strictly needed for the Supabase half — it's a dashboard setting — but call it out in the `CHANGELOG` and the pre-deployment checklist so nobody later wonders why the address differs between envs.
- [x] README: in "Email notifications" → update the triggers/recipients table to show detected/confirmed emails go to **both** owner and payer; update the Supabase SMTP note to show the specific sender address.

**Tests**
- [x] Extend existing payment-status and cron-sweep route tests to assert two email dispatches per transition (one per recipient) and that the payer send is skipped when `client_email` is blank.
- [x] Extend `src/lib/email/send.ts` tests (or add one) to confirm the split templates render without throwing.

**Done when:** A single `pending → payment_detected` transition results in exactly two emails (one to owner, one to payer) unless the payer has no email on file. All transactional mail and all Supabase auth mail come from `team@mail.satsend.me`.

---

### ✅ v1.4.5 — PDF Polish: Filename Format + Dropdown Download

**Branch:** `v1.4.5/pdf-polish`

**Context:** Two small PDF improvements. The filename is currently `invoice-<invoiceName>.pdf`, which is ambiguous across freelancers ("who is this invoice from?" when the payer is filing receipts). And the PDF can only be downloaded from the invoice detail page — not from the `/invoices` per-row dropdown, where users expect all invoice actions to live.

**Scope**
- [x] Change the PDF filename format to `<sender>_<invoiceName>_<YYYYMMDD>.pdf`, where:
  - `<sender>` = `your_company` if set, else `your_name` if set, else the prefix of `your_email` (everything before `@`), else literal `invoice`. Sanitise to filesystem-safe chars (strip `/`, `\`, leading/trailing whitespace; collapse internal whitespace to `_`).
  - `<invoiceName>` = `invoice_number` if set, else the short id `…xxxxxxxx`. Same sanitisation.
  - `<YYYYMMDD>` = the date the invoice was published (fallback: created_at), in UTC.
- [x] Centralise the filename builder in a pure helper (e.g. `src/lib/invoices/pdf-filename.ts`) with full unit tests covering each fallback branch and the sanitisation.
- [x] Apply the helper to both callers: the existing detail-page download, and the new dropdown action.
- [x] Add a `Download PDF` action to the `/invoices` per-row dropdown (`src/app/(dashboard)/invoices/row-actions.tsx` or wherever the existing actions live). Only shows for non-draft invoices (drafts shouldn't have a public URL / PDF). Reuses the same server endpoint as the detail-page download.

**Tests**
- [x] `src/lib/invoices/pdf-filename.test.ts` — covers every fallback branch (`your_company` missing, `your_name` missing, email-prefix path, everything missing), bad-character sanitisation, and the date format.
- [x] Update the dropdown actions test to assert `Download PDF` appears for non-draft rows and is wired to the correct URL.
- [x] **PDF content redesign** (added late in the branch): `Date Created` + `Date Due` (with `"No due date"` fallback) labels in the meta block; clickable hyperlink to the public invoice URL; brand-coloured header (pulled from new `src/lib/brand-colors.ts` module mirrored from `globals.css`); BIP-21 BTC QR code (no amount); clickable hyperlink to `buildSpotPriceUrl(currency)` (Coinbase spot endpoint). All driven by tests in `invoice-pdf.test.ts` using `pdf-parse`.

**Done when:** A PDF downloaded from either the dropdown or the detail page saves as `<sender>_<invoiceName>_<YYYYMMDD>.pdf`, with all sensible fallbacks.

---

### ⏳ v1.4.6 — Invoice UX Micro-fixes

**Branch:** `v1.4.6/invoice-ux-micro-fixes`

**Context:** A bundle of five independent UX annoyances reported during v1.4.1 manual testing. None of them warrant a branch on their own; grouped here for a single clean PR.

**Scope**
- [ ] **Rename "Mark as sent" → "Publish"** wherever it appears: invoice detail page action button, `/invoices` per-row dropdown, any toast / confirmation copy. The action also needs to *appear* in the per-row dropdown for `draft` rows (currently missing on the list view — only on the detail page), so drafts can be published from either surface. Underlying server action stays the same; UI label + surface only.
- [ ] **Prefill and lock `your_email`** on `/invoices/new` and `/invoices/[id]/edit` — read `session.user.email` on the server render and inject it into the form as a read-only (disabled or `readonly`) field. Remove the field from `InvoiceFormSchema` validation on the client so users can't bypass. This collapses the "two emails" confusion (account email vs invoice sender email). Per-invoice override is an explicit future non-goal — call it out in a code comment; a future branch can add it back behind a toggle.
- [ ] **Access codes: lowercase enforcement** — change the existing uppercase-on-input transform to lowercase-on-input. Typing `FOO12` becomes `foo12`. Easier to type on mobile, less ambiguous visually. Update `src/components/invoice-form.tsx` (or wherever the access code field lives) and the corresponding validation schema — no DB migration needed since existing codes are stored as-is; optionally write a one-off `UPDATE invoices SET access_code = lower(access_code)` if we want case-normalisation across existing rows.
- [ ] **Feedback when archiving an unarchivable invoice** — today, attempting to archive an invoice that's already archived (or a status that doesn't support archive) silently fails. Add toast feedback with a specific reason, and/or disable the action in the dropdown with a tooltip.
- [ ] **"Mark as overdue" missing from `/invoices` dropdown** for pending invoices — the detail page has the button, the list dropdown doesn't. Add it to the row-actions menu with the same conditional logic used on the detail page.

**Tests**
- [ ] Update dropdown-actions tests to assert "Publish" (renamed) and "Mark as overdue" appear with correct conditional visibility.
- [ ] Update invoice-form tests to assert the email field is read-only and pre-filled from session.
- [ ] Update access-code handling test to assert lowercase normalisation.

**Done when:** All five fixes are live and covered by tests; the draft-publishing UX is consistent between list and detail views; users can't enter mixed-case access codes.

---

### ⏳ v1.4.7 — Overdue Automation

**Branch:** `v1.4.7/overdue-automation`

**Context:** Today "overdue" is a fully manual status — the owner has to remember to click "Mark as overdue" after a due date passes, and the "Mark as overdue" button is offered indiscriminately even on invoices with no due date or with a due date in the future. This branch formalises the four cases into a tight state machine and automates the common one (case #1).

**Cases (from the user)**
- Case #1 — Invoice has a due date **in the past** and is unpaid → auto-flip status to `overdue` without owner intervention.
- Case #2 — Invoice has a due date **in the future** and is unpaid → **no** "Mark as overdue" button anywhere.
- Case #3 — Invoice has **no due date** and is unpaid → "Mark as overdue" button available (on both dropdown and detail page).
- Case #4 — Invoice has **no due date** and is `overdue` → "Mark as pending" button available (reverses case #3).

**Scope**
- [ ] Case #1 automation — extend the existing background cron (`/api/cron/payment-sweep`) or add a sibling cron to also flip unpaid `pending` rows with `due_date < now()` to `overdue`. Update `decidePaymentSchedule` or add a second decision fn so the "mark as overdue" write happens alongside / independently of payment polling. Schema: no changes — `overdue` already exists in the status enum.
- [ ] Alternative considered: a scheduled DB job / trigger doing the status flip without Next.js involvement. Rejected for v1.4 because it splits the source of truth; keeping all state transitions in TypeScript is simpler to test.
- [ ] Cases #2 / #3 / #4 — conditional rendering of the "Mark as overdue" / "Mark as pending" buttons on both the invoice row dropdown and the detail page, based on `due_date` presence and current status. One source-of-truth helper (e.g. `src/lib/invoices/overdue-actions.ts`) with `canMarkAsOverdue(invoice)` / `canMarkAsPending(invoice)`.
- [ ] Update the status badge to show "Overdue" when auto-flipped (no code change likely needed — the badge reads from `status` — but visually verify).
- [ ] Email (maybe) — do we notify the owner on auto-flip? Deferred for this branch. Owner sees it on next dashboard load; Realtime picks it up. Add a note in the "Out of scope" section.

**Tests**
- [ ] `decidePaymentSchedule` (or new fn) — unit tests for: pending with future due date → no flip; pending with past due date → flip to overdue; payment_detected with past due date → do NOT flip (payment is in flight); no due date → no flip.
- [ ] Button visibility logic — test the helper for all 4 cases.
- [ ] Integration-ish test on the cron endpoint — inject a pending invoice with `due_date` 1 minute in the past, run the cron, assert status flips.

**Out of scope**
- Email notification for auto-overdue flip.
- Configurable grace period (e.g. "mark as overdue 3 days after due date"). For now, flip the instant `due_date < now()`.

**Done when:** An unpaid invoice with a past due date auto-flips to overdue at the next cron tick without owner action; the "Mark as overdue" and "Mark as pending" buttons appear on the correct surfaces only in the right states.

---

### ⏳ v1.4.8 — BTC Address Hardening

**Branch:** `v1.4.8/btc-address-hardening`

**Context:** Two related gaps in BTC address validation discovered during v1.4 testing:

1. **Deleted-invoice reuse.** An owner deletes an invoice that had an address. The uniqueness check (currently "no BTC address reuse across non-draft invoices") is implemented by counting rows in `invoices` — but deleted rows are hard-deleted, so the address becomes free again. A malicious or careless owner can re-publish the same address on a new invoice, which at best fragments payment detection and at worst lets a paid-for-real payment detect against a stale invoice.
2. **Already-used addresses.** A freelancer pastes in a BTC address that already has on-chain history (e.g. reuse from a previous wallet, or a known-public address). mempool.space's balance + tx history gives this away. We should reject addresses with any prior receive history at publish time — it defends against both false-positive detections (prior txs matching the BTC amount) and against weak operational security (address reuse leaks counterparty privacy).

**Scope — deleted-invoice reuse**
- [ ] Soft-delete existing invoices instead of hard-delete. Option A: add a `deleted` enum value to the `status` enum + a `deleted_at` timestamp column; `deleteInvoice` sets status and stamps the timestamp rather than calling `.delete()`. Option B: add a separate `deleted_at` column only, and filter every existing query by `where deleted_at is null`. Option A is cleaner; Option B is a smaller migration. Pick one in the branch; lean A.
- [ ] Update the BTC uniqueness check in `src/app/(dashboard)/invoices/actions.ts` to continue matching against soft-deleted rows (but with a clearer error message: "This address was used on a deleted invoice").
- [ ] Hide deleted rows from all dashboard views (list, detail, Realtime) — they are DB-only at this point.
- [ ] Alternative considered — "only allow hard delete if the invoice was never paid". Rejected because address-reuse risks apply even to unpaid published invoices (a payer could still pay against the stale address after deletion).

**Scope — pre-publish balance check**
- [ ] Add a publish-time call to `GET https://mempool.space/api/address/<addr>` (existing helper in `src/lib/mempool.ts`) and reject if `chain_stats.tx_count > 0` or `mempool_stats.tx_count > 0`. Include the reason in the error ("This address has already received transactions — use a fresh address for each invoice").
- [ ] Cache the mempool response briefly (or not at all — publish is not a hot path).
- [ ] Graceful failure: if mempool.space is unreachable, **allow** publish and log a warning. Do not block the owner on an external dependency. Add a test asserting this fallback.
- [ ] Make the check conditional on `NEXT_PUBLIC_BTC_NETWORK` so testnet addresses are checked against the testnet4 endpoint.

**Tests**
- [ ] Uniqueness check against soft-deleted rows — publish, delete, try to re-publish same address → reject.
- [ ] Balance-check happy path — fresh address → accept.
- [ ] Balance-check rejection — address with existing tx history → reject with the specific message.
- [ ] Balance-check fallback — mempool down → accept with warning logged.

**Done when:** An owner cannot re-use a BTC address from a deleted invoice, and cannot publish an invoice against any address with any on-chain history (on whichever network is configured).

---

### ⏳ v1.4.9 — Payment Detection Latency (no "Mark as Sent" path)

**Branch:** `v1.4.9/payment-detection-latency`

**Context:** In v1.3.3 we shipped the "Mark as Payment Sent" dialog which front-loads mempool.space polling (5×2s + 5×3s + 3×5s + 2×10s = 15 polls / 60s). When the payer clicks that button, detection is fast — 2–10 seconds typical. But when the payer *doesn't* click it (just pays and closes the tab, or doesn't notice the button), detection falls back to the passive WebSocket watcher (A) and the background cron (C). The WebSocket is usually instant — but if it drops, the fallback polling starts at 10s and exponentially backs off. And if the tab closes before the WebSocket sees the tx, the payer has to wait for the cron — which is minute-granular at best, and the first cron-side poll is scheduled for +1m post-publish.

Real-world testing showed end-to-end latency in the "paid without clicking the button" case ranged from 10s (lucky WebSocket) to a minute+ (cron-only). The ask is: can we narrow the gap?

**Research phase (pre-implementation)**
- [ ] Document the exact request path and timing of each of the four detection mechanisms A/B/C/D with a Chrome DevTools capture: what requests fire, when, against which endpoints.
- [ ] Compare the "button-clicked" path (B) vs the "button-not-clicked" path (A + C) to identify the gap. Specifically: is the passive WebSocket reliably catching 0-conf tx broadcasts, or is it often the cron that wins?
- [ ] Look at mempool.space rate limits per IP — are we leaving headroom to poll more aggressively from the client?

**Implementation options (pick after research)**
- [ ] Option 1: **Lower the passive WebSocket fallback-polling start** from 10s → 2s (mirroring the "button clicked" cadence for the first 10–30 seconds after page open). Simpler; doesn't require the payer to do anything.
- [ ] Option 2: **Auto-trigger the button-clicked polling schedule** as soon as the payer scans / reveals the BTC address, without waiting for them to click. Benefit: full 60s-tiered cadence starts the moment they commit to paying. Risk: extra mempool.space load for every viewer.
- [ ] Option 3: **Tighten the cron's first scheduled check** from +1m to +15s post-publish, so even a closed-tab payer gets sub-minute detection from the server side. Cost: cron runs at up to 15s granularity per invoice — well within rate limit.
- [ ] Option 4: Some combination. Likely 1 + 3.

**Tests**
- [ ] Whatever path is chosen: unit tests for the new cadence, integration test simulating "pay but don't click" to assert detection latency is within the new target.

**Done when:** With "paid but button not clicked" as the scenario, detection happens within a measurably better bound than today (target: < 15s p50, < 60s p95), documented in the README.

### ⏳ v1.4.10 — Fiat Payment Flow + Manual Confirmation + Mark-as-Unpaid

**Branch:** `v1.4.10/fiat-payment-and-manual-confirmation`

**Context:** Three tightly coupled features:

1. **Fiat payment flow.** Today the public invoice page only offers "Pay in Bitcoin". Real invoices get paid in fiat too — bank transfer, Wise, etc. There's no way for a client to mark that they paid, and no way for the owner to acknowledge a fiat payment.
2. **New `marked_as_paid` status.** A client self-reports payment (either via fiat, or via BTC to an address not known to the platform — e.g. they accidentally sent to a previous invoice's address and want to reconcile). The invoice sits in `marked_as_paid` until the owner confirms and promotes it to `paid`.
3. **Mark-as-unpaid — but only for manual confirmations.** If an invoice reached `paid` via on-chain detection (we saw the tx), reverting it to unpaid would require replacing the BTC address (else future detections collide with the old tx). If it reached `paid` via manual confirmation, reverting is safe — no on-chain footprint to worry about. Conditional revert logic keyed on *how* the invoice was confirmed.

**Schema changes — new migration `supabase/migrations/0010_fiat_and_manual_confirmation.sql`**

```sql
alter type invoice_status add value if not exists 'marked_as_paid';

create type payment_method as enum ('bitcoin', 'fiat', 'bitcoin_offchain');
create type payment_confirmation_method as enum ('onchain', 'manual');

alter table invoices add column payment_method payment_method;
alter table invoices add column payment_confirmation_method payment_confirmation_method;
alter table invoices add column paid_at timestamptz;
```

- `payment_method` — set when the invoice reaches `marked_as_paid` or `paid`. Nullable until then.
- `payment_confirmation_method` — `onchain` if we detected the tx ourselves, `manual` if either party reported it. Drives mark-as-unpaid eligibility.
- `paid_at` — stamped at the transition to `paid`. Distinct from `updated_at`.

**Payer flow**
- [ ] Add a "Pay with <currency>" button on the public invoice page alongside "Pay with Bitcoin", visible only when the invoice has a fiat total (i.e. always, right now).
- [ ] Clicking opens a dialog with the user-supplied copy: *"By clicking confirm, you are marking this invoice as paid. To avoid any confusion with the payee, please do not click confirm until after you have made payment."* Cancel / Confirm buttons.
- [ ] Confirm → server action sets `status = marked_as_paid`, `payment_method = fiat`, `payment_confirmation_method = manual`. Sends a new email variant ("Your client has marked this invoice as paid in <currency>") to the owner.
- [ ] The same flow can fire with `payment_method = bitcoin_offchain` if we want to offer an "I paid in BTC to a different address" option. Deferred to a follow-up unless requested — for v1.4.10, fiat only.

**Owner flow**
- [ ] Owner sees `marked_as_paid` status on their dashboard with a dedicated badge colour.
- [ ] Detail page + per-row dropdown get a "Confirm payment received" action → transitions to `paid` with same `payment_method` / `payment_confirmation_method` preserved. Also a "Dispute / revert" action → transitions back to `pending`.
- [ ] On `marked_as_paid → paid`, send the existing payment-confirmed email (now going to both parties per v1.4.4).

**Mark-as-unpaid gating**
- [ ] Refactor the existing "Mark as unpaid" button to only render when `payment_confirmation_method = 'manual'`. If `onchain`, either hide the button or show it disabled with a tooltip ("on-chain payments cannot be reverted — the address would need to be replaced to avoid future collisions"). Preferred: hide entirely; tooltip introduces noise.
- [ ] When reverting an `onchain`-confirmed invoice is genuinely needed (edge case: the owner knows the tx was unrelated), offer a separate "Replace BTC address and revert" flow — presents an address input, validates it (including the v1.4.8 balance check), updates both fields atomically, resets `payment_confirmation_method` to null. Deferred unless requested; not blocking v1.4.10.

**Status enum surface area**
- [ ] All existing UI that switches on `status` needs to handle `marked_as_paid` — status badge colour/label, filters on `/invoices`, the PDF renderer. Audit everywhere with `grep -r "'paid'" src/` and `grep -r "'payment_detected'" src/` — every place that has those cases needs a `marked_as_paid` case.

**Tests**
- [ ] Pure logic: the `onchain` vs `manual` gate for mark-as-unpaid.
- [ ] Server action: "client marks as paid in fiat" happy path; ownership check (can't mark-as-paid somebody else's invoice); idempotency (double-click doesn't double-email).
- [ ] Integration test — full fiat flow: payer marks, owner confirms, status ends at `paid` with `payment_method = fiat` and `payment_confirmation_method = manual`.
- [ ] Integration test — on-chain-confirmed invoice does not expose "Mark as unpaid".

**Out of scope (for this branch)**
- Multi-currency handling beyond the single currency stored on the invoice (v2.4 territory).
- "Replace BTC address and revert" flow (deferred).
- Partial payments (never supported today; still not).

**Done when:** A client can mark a fiat invoice as paid from the public page; the owner gets an email and can confirm it (→ `paid`) or revert it (→ `pending`); mark-as-unpaid is only offered for manual confirmations; every code path that switches on status handles the new enum value.

### ⏳ v1.4.11 — Rename Paybitty → SatSend

**Branch:** `v1.4.11/rename-to-satsend`

**Context:** The product has been renamed from **Paybitty** to **SatSend**. This is the rename branch — purely mechanical, no behaviour changes. Lands as the final patch in the v1.4 train so that the v1.5 design-system overhaul starts from a clean-branded codebase.

**Scope**
- [ ] `package.json` — `name` field (also affects lockfile; regenerate via `npm install`).
- [ ] All email templates in `src/lib/email/templates/*.tsx` — subject lines, body copy, preview text.
- [ ] All page metadata: `src/app/layout.tsx` (`title`, `description`, `openGraph`), per-route metadata, favicon + manifest if branded.
- [ ] Navbar logo text (`src/components/nav.tsx` or equivalent).
- [ ] All hard-coded UI copy — run `grep -ri "paybitty" src/` and address every hit. Common categories: loading states, toast text, button labels, empty-state illustrations' alt text.
- [ ] All docs: `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` (only in the current-version preamble, not historical entries — those stay for provenance), `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `development/ROADMAP.md` (title line at the top), every file in `manual-tests/`.
- [ ] `.env.example` if it exists; comments inside `.env`; no actual secret values change.
- [ ] Branch naming convention — going forward, still `vX.Y.Z/<slug>`, the project name is not in the branch slug.
- [ ] Custom domain — if a `paybitty.*` domain was provisioned on Vercel, plan the cutover separately (Pre-deployment Checklist). Not in scope for this branch.

**Strategy**
- [ ] Run `grep -ril "paybitty" .` once to inventory every reference. Commit the inventory to the branch description for review, then fix in logical groups (docs / templates / UI copy / code comments).
- [ ] Be careful with **partial-word** matches — `PayBitty`, `paybitty`, `PAYBITTY`. A case-insensitive grep will catch them; run each variant through manual review since the replacement (`SatSend`) has a different capitalisation pattern.
- [ ] **Historical commits, CHANGELOG entries tagged for prior releases, and git tags** do NOT get rewritten — they document a point-in-time state. Only active/living copy gets updated.

**Tests**
- [ ] Typecheck + lint + existing test suite all green (no behavioural changes, so no new tests needed).
- [ ] Visual smoke: open every major page and confirm no stray "Paybitty" string is visible.
- [ ] Email smoke: publish a test invoice, confirm the subject line and body read "SatSend".

**Done when:** `grep -ril "paybitty" src/ app/ docs/ *.md *.json` returns zero matches (or only intentionally-preserved history entries in `CHANGELOG.md`); the visible product — UI, emails, PDFs, page titles, nav — reads "SatSend" everywhere.

### ⏳ v1.5 — Design System Overhaul

**Branch:** `v1.5/design-system`

> **Block:** Colour scheme decision needed from you before implementation begins. See notes below.

**Colour scheme**
- [ ] DECISION: You to choose new colour scheme — current palette (near-black bg, dark surface, red `#DE3C4B` accent) lacks visual variety and makes it hard to differentiate button intent (e.g. primary action vs destructive vs secondary). New scheme should include at least one additional highlight colour and provide enough contrast between action types.
- [ ] Implement new colour scheme across CSS variables / Tailwind config
- [ ] Audit all buttons and badges to ensure each action type (primary, secondary, destructive, neutral) is visually distinct under the new scheme

**Light / dark mode**
- [ ] Add dark/light mode toggle to the navbar
- [ ] Ensure all components render correctly in both modes (Tailwind `dark:` variants)
- [ ] Persist mode preference to `localStorage`

**Done when:** Colour scheme decision is made and implemented, all button states are visually distinct, and both dark and light mode work correctly throughout the app.

---

### ⏳ v1.6 — Bitcoin Enhancements

**Branch:** `v1.6/btc-enhancements`

- [ ] Optional BTC discount field on invoice creation (% value, e.g. 5%)
- [ ] Discount only applies if the invoice is paid in Bitcoin — shown on the client payment view as a line item reducing the BTC amount
- [ ] Discount displayed on client view alongside the BTC amount (e.g. "5% BTC discount — save $X")
- [ ] Discount not reflected in the fiat total; it is a BTC-payment incentive only

**Done when:** A freelancer can offer a percentage discount to clients who pay in BTC, visible only on the payment view.

---

### ⏳ v1.7 — Address Format Standardisation

**Branch:** `v1.7/address-fields`

> **Note:** This branch changes the address data model. Should land before v2.3 (saved client/sender details) since those features depend on the address structure.

- [ ] Replace single freeform `your_address` / `client_address` text fields with structured fields: Line 1, Line 2, City, State/Province, Post Code, Country — following the UN/OASIS xNAL address standard ordering
- [ ] Schema migration: add individual address sub-columns (nullable); keep old `*_address` column for migration only, then drop after backfill
- [ ] Update invoice form with the new multi-field address layout
- [ ] Update invoice detail page (user view) and client payment view to render the structured address correctly
- [ ] No auto-fill or address lookup required

**Done when:** All address inputs are structured multi-field; old freeform address column removed; views render the structured address neatly.

**Branch:** `v2.0/billing`

- [ ] Lemon Squeezy integration
- [ ] Free tier enforcement: 5 invoices/month cap
- [ ] Paid tier: unlimited invoices
- [ ] BTC one-time payments for 1-month / 6-month / 1-year plans

---

### 🚫 v2.1 — OAuth

**Branch:** `v2.1/oauth`

---

### 🚫 v2.3 — Address Book + Reusable Items

**Branch:** `v2.3/address-book`

> **Depends on:** v1.7 (address format standardisation) — saved addresses use the structured multi-field format.

**Saved client details**
- [ ] User can save up to 5 client profiles (name, email, company, structured address, tax ID)
- [ ] Client selector on invoice creation form — choosing a saved client pre-fills all client fields
- [ ] Manage saved clients: add, edit, delete from a settings or clients page

**Saved sender (own) details**
- [ ] User can save one set of their own invoicing details (name, email, company, structured address, tax ID)
- [ ] "Your details" section on invoice creation pre-fills from saved profile if one exists
- [ ] User can update their saved details from settings

**Reusable items**
- [ ] Reusable service/line item templates

---

### 🚫 v2.4 — Multi-Currency Support

**Branch:** `v2.4/multi-currency`

- [ ] Currency selector on invoice creation (USD, EUR, GBP, AUD, CAD, etc.)
- [ ] BTC price fetched in the selected fiat currency
- [ ] Dashboard shows currency alongside invoice totals

---

## Notes

- Billing (v2.0+) is fully deferred until v1 is stable and in use.
- xpub / HD wallet support is permanently rejected — security risk if the key leaks.
- Light mode and colour scheme overhaul are tracked in v1.5.

## Pre-deployment Checklist

Project is not yet linked to Vercel. Before first deployment, run `vercel link` and mirror all `.env` values into Vercel project env vars (Production, Preview, Development):

- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- [ ] `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (if used server-side)
- [ ] `RESEND_API_KEY` (added v1.4)
- [ ] `CRON_SECRET` (added v1.4.1) — bearer token the Vercel Cron endpoint validates. Vercel generates this when you configure the cron in the dashboard; mirror it into `.env.local` for local `curl` testing.
- [ ] **Verify a sending domain in the Resend dashboard** and set `EMAIL_FROM` to an address on that domain. Without a verified domain, Resend only delivers to the email address on the Resend account itself — sends to any other recipient (clients, test addresses) return a 422 and the email never arrives. This is a Resend free-tier safety rail, not a Paybitty bug.
- [ ] **Sender identity unified (v1.4.4)** — set `EMAIL_FROM="SatSend <team@mail.satsend.me>"` in `.env` and in Vercel project env vars (Production, Preview, Development). Confirm the Supabase custom SMTP "Sender" address (dashboard → Project Settings → Auth → SMTP Settings → Sender) is set to the same `team@mail.satsend.me` so transactional mail and auth mail share a single `From:` identity.
- [x] **Supabase custom SMTP → Resend** — configured 2026-04-24 in Supabase dashboard (Project Settings → Auth → SMTP Settings) pointing at `smtp.resend.com:465` with the `RESEND_API_KEY` as the password and a sender on the verified `mail.satsend.me` domain. This routes all Supabase auth emails (magic link, signup confirmation, password reset) through Resend and bypasses Supabase's default ~4/hour rate limit. Project-level setting — applies to both local dev and production automatically.
- [ ] Any other secrets present in `.env` at deploy time
